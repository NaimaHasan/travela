# Travela

Travela is a website built with Flutter aiming to help travellers plan their trips and find locations of interest, and coordinate itineraries with fellow travellers. Users could locate nearby hotels, restaurants and destinations, view them on a map and add them to an itinerary. Users could also share itineraries with other users, and coordinate schedules and travel plans.
